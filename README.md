# Logo Generator

This is a simple logo generator application that allows users to generate logos for their projects. Users can input text, choose text and shape colors, and select a shape from options like circle, triangle, and square. The application then generates an SVG file based on the user input.

## Usage

To use the logo generator:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` to start the application.
5. Follow the prompts to input text, colors, and shape.
6. The generated logo will be saved as `logo.svg` in the project directory.
